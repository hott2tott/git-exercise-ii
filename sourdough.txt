I've been exposed to sourdough baking my whole life. My
maternal grandfather initially started the sourdough 
starter that he, my mom, myself, and many others in our
family now use. I try to use my sourdough starter at least
once per week. Some of my favorite recipes are for slow-
fermented sourdough bread and sourdough granola. My 
husband's favorites include sourdough breadsticks and 
sourdough foccacia.
When I tell people that I enjoy sourdough baking, they 
usually have a lot of questions about the complexities.
I like to say that sourdough doesn't really have any 
rules, and it's easily adaptable to your time, preferences,
and desires.
Sourdough starter is just flour and water, and you can use
the discard (the amount of starter removed when you feed) or
you can, literally, discard it. You feed your starter with
equal measures of flour and water, mix well, leave out 
overnight, and that's it! I store my starter in the fridge
the rest of the time so it doesn't go bad.
King Arthur Baking has a wonderful collection of recipes,
tips, and tricks for sourdough baking. Good luck!
